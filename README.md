## Baseline 2024 CSS Feature Implementation

### Feature: `light-dark()` Function

This portfolio implements the `light-dark()` CSS function, which is part of the Baseline 2024 features. The `light-dark()` function provides automatic color adaptation based on the user's preferred color scheme (light or dark mode). This function works in conjunction with the `color-scheme` property to automatically select appropriate colors without requiring JavaScript or manual theme switching. When a user's system preference is set to dark mode, the function automatically uses the second color value; when set to light mode, it uses the first value. This provides a seamless, native dark mode experience that respects user preferences and improves accessibility for users who prefer reduced brightness or have visual sensitivities.
